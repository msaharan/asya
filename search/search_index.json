An actor is a stateless (by default) workload that: Receives messages from an input queue Processes them via user-defined code Sends results to the next queue in the route Key characteristics : Stateless by design - no persistent state between messages Independently scalable based on queue depth Independently deployable as Kubernetes workloads Motivation : Alternative to monolithic pipelines. Instead of one large pipeline A \u2192 B \u2192 C , each step is an independent actor that can scale and deploy separately. See : architecture/asya-actor.md for details. Sidecar \u00b6 Responsibilities : Message routing between queues and runtime Transport management (RabbitMQ, SQS) Observability (metrics, logs) Reliability (retries, error handling) How it works : Injected as a container into actor pods. Consumes messages from queues, validates envelopes, forwards to runtime via Unix socket, routes responses to next queue. See : architecture/asya-sidecar.md for details. Runtime \u00b6 Responsibilities : User code execution Processing input messages Generating output messages How it works : Receives messages from sidecar via Unix socket, loads user handler (function or class), executes it, returns results back to sidecar. Deployment : User defines container image with Python code. Asya operator injects asya_runtime.py entrypoint script via ConfigMap. See : architecture/asya-runtime.md for details. Crew Actors \u00b6 Special system actors for framework-level tasks: happy-end : Persists successful results to S3/MinIO, reports success to gateway error-end : Handles failures (coming soon), implements retry logic, reports errors to gateway more crew actors coming soon Future crew actors : Stateful fan-in aggregation Custom monitoring and alerting See : architecture/asya-crew.md for details. Queues \u00b6 Interface : Send, receive, ack, nack messages Transport types : SQS : AWS-managed queue service RabbitMQ : Self-hosted open-source message broker Pluggable design : Transport layer is abstracted - adding new transports (Kafka, NATS, Pub/Sub) requires implementing transport interface. See : architecture/transports/README.md for details. Envelope \u00b6 Definition : JSON object passed between actors via message queues. Structure : { \"id\" : \"unique-envelope-id\" , \"route\" : { \"actors\" : [ \"preprocess\" , \"inference\" , \"postprocess\" ], \"current\" : 0 }, \"headers\" : { \"trace_id\" : \"...\" , \"priority\" : \"high\" }, \"payload\" : { \"data\" : \"arbitrary user data\" } } Fields : id (required): Unique identifier for tracking route (required): Actor list and current position payload (required): User data processed by actors headers (optional): Routing metadata (traces, priorities) Envelope vs Message : At queue level, messages are bytes. Envelopes are JSON objects with pre-defined structure. Stateful routing : route.current increments after each actor processes the envelope. Note once again, this is a unique feature of Asya\ud83c\udfad: pipelines are stateless, but envelopes are stateful (they represent different pipeline executions). See : architecture/protocols/actor-actor.md for details. Operator \u00b6 Responsibilities : Manages lifecycle of AsyncActor CRDs Injects sidecars into actor pods Creates Kubernetes Deployments/StatefulSets Configures KEDA autoscaling Creates and manages message queues How it works : Watches AsyncActor custom resources, reconciles desired state with actual cluster state, injects infrastructure components. See : architecture/asya-operator.md for details. KEDA (Autoscaling) \u00b6 Benefits : Automatic scaling based on queue depth or custom metrics Scale to zero - eliminate idle resource costs Handle bursty workloads efficiently Integration : Asya operator creates KEDA ScaledObjects for each AsyncActor. KEDA monitors queue depth and scales actor deployments from 0 to maxReplicas. Example : Queue has 100 messages, queueLength=5 configured \u2192 KEDA scales to 20 replicas (100/5). See : architecture/autoscaling.md for details. MCP Gateway (Optional) \u00b6 As an optional component, Asya\ud83c\udfad offers an MCP-compliant HTTP gateway, which allows external clients to easily consume async pipelines as MCP tools. Responsibilities : Exposes MCP-compliant HTTP API Receives HTTP requests, creates envelopes Tracks envelope status in PostgreSQL Streams progress updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE) How it works : Client calls tool \u2192 Gateway creates envelope \u2192 Sends to first actor's queue \u2192 Crew actors report status back \u2192 Gateway streams updates to client. Use case : Easy integration for external systems or user-facing APIs. See : architecture/asya-gateway.md for details.

Receive Phase \u00b6 Queue \u2192 Transport.Receive() \u2192 Router.ProcessMessage() - Long polling from queue (configurable wait time) - Parse JSON message structure - Validate route information 2. Processing Phase \u00b6 Router \u2192 Runtime Client \u2192 Unix Socket \u2192 Actor Runtime - Extract payload from message - Send payload to runtime via Unix socket - Wait for response with timeout - Handle multiple response scenarios: - Single response - Fan-out (array of responses) - Empty response (abort) - Error response - Timeout (no response) 3. Routing Phase \u00b6 Router \u2192 Route Management \u2192 Transport.Send() \u2192 Next Queue - Increment route.current counter - Determine next destination: - Next actor in route if available - Happy-end if route complete or empty response - Error-end if error or timeout - Send message(s) to destination queue(s) 4. Acknowledgment Phase \u00b6 Router \u2192 Transport.Ack/Nack() - ACK on successful processing - NACK on error for retry Response Handling Summary \u00b6 Response Action Single value Route to next actor Array (fan-out) Route each to next actor Empty Send to happy-end Error Send to error-end Timeout Send to error-end End of route Send to happy-end Transport Interface \u00b6 All transports implement this interface: type Transport interface { Receive ( ctx context . Context , queueName string ) ( QueueMessage , error ) Send ( ctx context . Context , queueName string , body [] byte ) error Ack ( ctx context . Context , msg QueueMessage ) error Nack ( ctx context . Context , msg QueueMessage ) error Close () error } Transport failures \u00b6 Asya\ud83c\udfad operator owns the queues if deployed with ASYA_QUEUE_AUTO_CREATE=true . This means, it will try to recreate a queue if it doesn't exist or its configuration is not as desired. Sidecar can detect queue errors and fail after graceful period that will cause pod restart. Consider scenario: 1. Queue gets deleted (chaos scenario, accidental deletion, infrastructure failure) 2. Sidecar detects missing queue when trying to consume messages 3. Sidecar retries with exponential backoff ( ASYA_QUEUE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS=10 attempts, ASYA_QUEUE_RETRY_BACKOFF=1s seconds initial backoff) 4. Operator health check (every 5 min) detects missing queue and recreates it (if ASYA_QUEUE_AUTO_CREATE=true ) 5. Sidecar successfully reconnects once queue is recreated (or enters failing state otherwise) Runtime Protocol \u00b6 Request Format \u00b6 Raw JSON bytes (payload only) Success Response \u00b6 Runtime returns the mutated payload directly: Single value: { \"processed\" : true , \"timestamp\" : \"2025-10-24T12:00:00Z\" } Array (fan-out): [{ \"chunk\" : 1 }, { \"chunk\" : 2 }] Empty (no further processing): null or [] Error Response \u00b6 { \"error\" : \"error_code\" , \"message\" : \"Error description\" , \"type\" : \"ExceptionType\" } End Actor Mode \u00b6 For end actors (happy-end, error-end), set ASYA_IS_END_ACTOR=true to disable response routing. export ASYA_ACTOR_NAME = happy-end export ASYA_IS_END_ACTOR = true ./bin/sidecar The sidecar will consume messages, forward to runtime, discard responses, and ACK. This is used for end-of-pipeline processing where no further routing is needed. Deployment Patterns \u00b6 Kubernetes Sidecar (Automatic) \u00b6 The Asya\ud83c\udfad operator automatically injects the sidecar when you deploy an AsyncActor CRD. Manual Deployment \u00b6 containers : - name : asya-runtime image : my-actor:latest volumeMounts : - name : socket mountPath : /tmp/sockets - name : sidecar image : asya-sidecar:latest env : - name : ASYA_ACTOR_NAME value : \"my-actor-queue\" volumeMounts : - name : socket mountPath : /tmp/sockets volumes : - name : socket emptyDir : {} Error Handling Strategy \u00b6 Error Type Action Destination Parse error Log + send error error-end Runtime error Log + send error error-end Timeout Log + construct error error-end Empty response Log + send original happy-end Transport error Log + NACK retry queue Shutdown signal Graceful NACK retry queue Configuration \u00b6 All configuration via environment variables: Variable Default Description ASYA_ACTOR_NAME (required) Queue to consume ASYA_SOCKET_PATH /tmp/sockets/app.sock Unix socket path ASYA_RUNTIME_TIMEOUT 5m Response timeout ASYA_STEP_HAPPY_END happy-end Success queue ASYA_STEP_ERROR_END error-end Error queue ASYA_IS_END_ACTOR false End actor mode ASYA_GATEWAY_URL \"\" Gateway URL for progress reporting (optional) ASYA_RABBITMQ_URL amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/ RabbitMQ connection ASYA_RABBITMQ_EXCHANGE asya Exchange name ASYA_RABBITMQ_PREFETCH 1 Prefetch count Benefits : No config files to manage Container-friendly Easy per-environment customization Validation on startup Concurrency Model \u00b6 Current : Single-threaded sequential processing - One message at a time - Simple error handling - Predictable behavior Future : Configurable worker pool - Concurrent message processing - Higher throughput - More complex error scenarios Failure Behavior and Recovery \u00b6 Sidecar Container Failure \u00b6 What happens: - Kubernetes automatically restarts the sidecar container ( restartPolicy: Always ) - Messages in-flight are NACK'd and redelivered by RabbitMQ - Runtime container continues running independently Message guarantees: - \u2705 No message loss (NACK before ACK) - \u26a0\ufe0f Possible duplicate processing if sidecar dies after routing but before ACK - \u2705 Fast recovery (sub-second container restart) Critical window: Between routing response to the next actor and ACK current message. If sidecar crashes in this window, the next queue receives the message but RabbitMQ redelivers the original. Runtime Container Failure \u00b6 Crash/OOM Kill \u00b6 Detection: Sidecar fails to connect to Unix socket ( failed to connect to runtime socket ) Recovery: 1. Sidecar routes message to error-end queue with connection error 2. Kubernetes restarts runtime container automatically 3. Socket recreated on shared emptyDir volume 4. Next message attempt succeeds Message fate: Sent to error-end for retry logic (not automatically retried) Timeout (Hung Process) \u00b6 Detection: No response within ASYA_RUNTIME_TIMEOUT (default: 5m) Recovery: 1. Socket read returns context.DeadlineExceeded 2. Message sent to error-end with timeout error 3. \u26a0\ufe0f Container NOT restarted (no liveness probe configured) 4. Runtime becomes a zombie, failing all subsequent messages Operational impact: Requires manual pod restart or liveness probe configuration. User Code Exception \u00b6 Detection: Runtime returns error response with traceback Recovery: 1. Error routed to error-end with full exception details 2.

Overview \u00b6 As a data scientist, you focus on writing pure Python functions. Asya handles infrastructure, routing, scaling, and monitoring. Core pattern : Mutate and enrich the payload - not request/response. Each actor adds its results to the payload, which flows through the pipeline. See archtecture/protocols/actor-actor.md for more details. Write a handler function or class: # handler.py def process ( payload : dict ) -> dict : # Your logic here <...> result = your_ml_model . predict ( payload [ \"input\" ]) # Recommendation: enrich payload, don't replace it return { ** payload , # Keep existing data \"prediction\" : result # Add your results } That's it. No infrastructure code, no decorators, no pip dependencies for queues/routing. Mutating Payloads \u00b6 Pattern : Each actor enriches the payload by adding its own fields. The enriched payload flows to the next actor. Function Handler \u00b6 # preprocessor.py def process ( payload : dict ) -> dict : text = payload . get ( \"text\" , \"\" ) return { ** payload , # Preserve input \"cleaned_text\" : text . strip () . lower (), \"word_count\" : len ( text . split ()) } Class Handler \u00b6 Class handlers allow stateful initialization - perfect for loading models once at startup: # classifier.py class TextClassifier : def __init__ ( self , model_path : str = \"/models/default\" ): # Loaded once at pod startup, not per message self . model = load_model ( model_path ) print ( f \"Model loaded from { model_path } \" ) def process ( self , payload : dict ) -> dict : text = payload . get ( \"cleaned_text\" , \"\" ) prediction = self . model . predict ( text ) # Add classification results to payload return { ** payload , # Keep preprocessor results \"category\" : prediction [ \"category\" ], \"confidence\" : prediction [ \"score\" ] } IMPORTANT : All __init__ parameters must have default values: # \u2705 Correct def __init__ ( self , model_path : str = \"/models/default\" ): ... # \u274c Wrong - missing default def __init__ ( self , model_path : str ): ... Pipeline Flow Example \u00b6 # Actor 1: preprocessor { \"text\" : \"Hello World\" } \u2192 { \"text\" : \"Hello World\" , \"cleaned_text\" : \"hello world\" , \"word_count\" : 2 } # Actor 2: classifier { \"text\" : \"Hello World\" , \"cleaned_text\" : \"hello world\" , \"word_count\" : 2 } \u2192 { \"text\" : \"Hello World\" , \"cleaned_text\" : \"hello world\" , \"word_count\" : 2 , \"category\" : \"greeting\" , \"confidence\" : 0.95 } # Actor 3: translator { \"text\" : \"Hello World\" , ... , \"category\" : \"greeting\" , \"confidence\" : 0.95 } \u2192 { \"text\" : \"Hello World\" , ... , \"category\" : \"greeting\" , \"confidence\" : 0.95 , \"translation\" : \"Hola Mundo\" } Each actor adds its own fields, preserving all previous work. Fan-Out Pattern \u00b6 Return a list to create multiple envelopes for parallel processing: def process ( payload : dict ) -> list : # Split text into chunks chunks = payload [ \"text\" ] . split ( \" \\n \" ) # Each chunk becomes a separate envelope return [ { ** payload , \"chunk_id\" : i , \"chunk_text\" : chunk } for i , chunk in enumerate ( chunks ) ] Result : Sidecar creates multiple envelopes (one per list item), routes each to the next actor in parallel. Abort Pattern \u00b6 Return None or [] to stop pipeline execution: def process ( payload : dict ) -> dict | None : # Skip processing if already done if payload . get ( \"already_processed\" ): return None # Routes to happy-end, no further processing # Normal processing return { ** payload , \"result\" : \"...\" } Local Development \u00b6 1. Write Handler \u00b6 # text_processor.py def process ( payload : dict ) -> dict : text = payload . get ( \"text\" , \"\" ) return { ** payload , \"processed\" : text . upper (), \"length\" : len ( text ) } 2. Test Locally \u00b6 # test_handler.py from text_processor import process payload = { \"text\" : \"hello world\" , \"request_id\" : \"123\" } result = process ( payload ) assert result == { \"text\" : \"hello world\" , \"request_id\" : \"123\" , # Original data preserved \"processed\" : \"HELLO WORLD\" , \"length\" : 11 } No infrastructure needed for testing - pure Python functions. 3. Package in Docker \u00b6 CI/CD is out of scope of Asya\ud83c\udfad framework - ask your platform team for support. FROM python:3.13-slim WORKDIR /app COPY text_processor.py /app/ # Install dependencies (if any) # RUN pip install --no-cache-dir torch transformers CMD [ \"python3\" , \"-c\" , \"import text_processor; print('Handler loaded')\" ] docker build -t my-processor:v1 .

Envelope mode gives you full control over the routing structure: env : - name : ASYA_HANDLER_MODE value : \"envelope\" # Receive full envelope, not just payload # llm_judge.py class LLMJudge : def __init__ ( self , threshold : float = 0.8 ): self . model = load_llm ( \"/models/judge\" ) self . threshold = float ( threshold ) def process ( self , envelope : dict ) -> dict : # Envelope structure: # { # \"id\": \"...\", # \"payload\": {...}, # Your data # \"route\": { # \"actors\": [\"preprocessor\", \"llm-judge\", \"postprocessor\"], # \"current\": 1 # Points to current actor (llm-judge) # } # } payload = envelope [ \"payload\" ] # Run LLM judge score = self . model . judge ( payload [ \"llm_response\" ]) payload [ \"judge_score\" ] = score # Dynamically modify route based on score route = envelope [ \"route\" ] if score < self . threshold : # Low quality response - add refinement step route [ \"actors\" ] . insert ( route [ \"current\" ] + 1 , # After current position \"llm-refiner\" # Extra step ) # Increment current pointer route [ \"current\" ] += 1 return envelope Important : Route modification rules: \u2705 Can add/replace future steps \u2705 Can insert actors after current position \u274c Cannot modify already-processed steps \u274c Cannot change which actor route.current points to Error Handling \u00b6 Asya automatically handles exceptions: def process ( payload : dict ) -> dict : if \"required_field\" not in payload : raise ValueError ( \"Missing required_field\" ) # Normal processing result = do_work ( payload [ \"required_field\" ]) return { ** payload , \"result\" : result } When exception occurs : 1. Runtime catches exception and creates error envelope with traceback 2. Sidecar routes to asya-error-end queue 3. Error-end actor persists error details to S3 4. Gateway receives final failure status No manual error handling needed - framework handles everything. Monitoring \u00b6 Your platform team will set up monitoring dashboards. For quick checks: Note : More comprehensive monitoring capabilities (dashboards, alerts, metrics) are coming soon. Ask your platform team about current monitoring setup.
